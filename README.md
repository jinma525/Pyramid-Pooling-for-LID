# Pyramid-Pooling-for-LID
The concept of Pyramid Pooling is presented in [Spatial Pyramid Pooling in Deep Convolutional Networks for Visual Recognition](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~sqren/SPP/spp_eccv2014.pdf) and this repository including some experiments on it.

### ./Others/ConvolutionTransposeHint.m
This is just a small m file to see how convolution transpose layer works. This concept was proposed in [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~fergus/papers/zeilerECCV2014.pdf)
